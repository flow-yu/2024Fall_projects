# 2024 Fall Final Project - X-game

The work was collaborated by Jiachen Yu(jy91) and YouPeng(youpeng2). I was responsible for basic game modeling, and YouPeng tried more about the game strategy(like the Menace).

X, by Mark Steere, is a three player game played on a diamond shaped board with a hexagonal pattern. An introduction pdf can be found in https://www.marksteeregames.com/X_rules.pdf.

## Code Implementation 
Here is the detail for the board modeling.
